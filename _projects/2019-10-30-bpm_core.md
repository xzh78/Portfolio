I accompanied the product through its **full product cycle**, including design definition, component sourcing, product conception, prototyping, design validation, tooling launching, and assembly validation through to production.

Working on a healthcare product requires extreme attention to the <b>accuracy of the measurements</b>.I went through a large body of literature and many design iterations in order to eliminate mechanical interferences to the measurements.

As a mechanical engineer, I led the **selection of materials** for the product. I am always fascinated by the myriad of factors that need to be taken into account when selecting materials for a lasting product: from their mechanical properties (hardness, weight, conductivity, Young modulus, etc.), aesthetics properties (color, finishing, coating) to their fabrication processes and costs.
