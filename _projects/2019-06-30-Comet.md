    <p>COMET is a <b>passenger vehicle</b> inspired by quadrotor drone, using a hydraulic propulsion system to obtain a battery life up to three hours, compared to 15 min of similar structures. </p>
    <p>In collaboration with the Department of Mechanical Systems of UTC, I proposed and designed the physical structure of this passenger drone. </p>

By introducing design elements from automotive industry, the passenger drone inspires confidence and familiarity for passengers in this novel mode of individual transportation. 

Provided with a basic set of technical constraints, I set out to rethink what individual transportation would look like in the air.

Rethinking transportation in 3D also means taking into account novel safety considerations: visual signaling should be visible from different angles, which is why the front and rear lights are sloped to convey the driver's intention to other commuters.
