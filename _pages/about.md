      I am a London-based multidisciplinary designer with a background in mechanical engineering and product design. I am currently studying towards the MA/MSc Innovation Design Engineering, at Royal College of Art and Imperial College London. I worked as a product design engineer in Paris prior to my Masters, gaining valuable product design and development experience through sophisticated yet accessible healthcare products.

      My unique cross-cultural and cross-functional background have enabled me to become the designer I am today, able to better understand the needs of the users and to approach product ideas with an open-mind. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy exploring the relationship between humans and objects. I believe designers should shape the way people interact with each other and with the environment, bringing positive impact to the society.
